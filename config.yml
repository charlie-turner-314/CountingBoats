# Technical Configuration
TILE_SIZE:
  416 # Size of tiles to split images into for processing
  # I do beleive YOLO will resize images to work, but this should be the same as the YOLO model expects for best results
STRIDE: 104 # Stride for overlapping tiles

CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: 0.5
STAT_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_PIX: 3
MOVING_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_PIX: 6
# The lat/long cutoff should be roughly related to the resolution of the images
# For 3m resolution, 10 pix is roughly 30m. At approx -27 deg lat, this is approx 0.0003 degrees.
STAT_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_LATLONG: 0.00025
MOVING_DISTANCE_CUTOFF_LATLONG: 0.0003

# Automation Configuration
AUTO_MODE: "batch" # 'batch' or 'single' - whether to run in batch mode or all history at once
HISTORY_LENGTH: 60 # Days in the past to fetch (new) imagery for
# OR (HISTORY_LENGTH takes precedence):
# START_DATE: "2024-06-01" # Date to start fetching imagery from
# END_DATE: "2024-06-20" # Date to stop fetching imagery from
BATCH_SIZE: 10 # Number of days to process (order -> download -> infer) before moving on to next batch

ALLOWED_CLOUD_COVER: 0.75 # Fraction of image which can be covered by clouds
MINIMUM_AREA_COVERAGE: 0 # Fraction of interest area which must be present to download
AOIS: "peel" # Specific AOIs to fetch imagery for (comma separated names of polygons) or "all" for all AOIs in data/polygons

HEATMAP_SIZE: 100 # Size of each heatmap square (in meters)
