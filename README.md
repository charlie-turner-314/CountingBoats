# Counting Boats

## Why

Moreton Bay is a complex ecosystem, home to a myriad of marine life, while at the 
same time being a heavily used and enjoyed swimming, boating, and fishing area for humans. 
Understanding the interactions between human activity and marine life is a crucial aspect
to ensure that the bay can be enjoyed by all species for years to come. This project 
is a small part of the much wider [Living and Playing Together Project](https://moretonbayfoundation.org/research/living-and-playing-together).

## How

This project utilises satellite images, and harnesses the power of machine learning
object detection, to count small marine vessels (boats) in the Moreton Bay area.
Extendable to any images from any area, the reccommended pipeline runs as follows:

1. Using Planet, satellite images of the area of interest are gathered each day.
2. Our YOLOv5 ML classifier finds stationary and moving boats in the area
3. We collate and analyse the boat counts as time-series data
