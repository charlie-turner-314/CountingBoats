"""
This file is used to create coverage heatmaps for the UDM images.
The coverage heatmaps show the number of times each grid cell has been imaged by a UDM image.
The grid cells are defined by a grid size (e.g. 500m x 500m) and the extent of the area of interest.
The coverage heatmaps are saved to a CSV file with columns: year, gridx, gridy, count.
For efficiency, the coverage heatmaps are generated in parallel using multiprocessing and cached to disk in .pkl files.
The UDM clear masks are also cached to disk in .npz files for faster loading.
